# analyzemymeeting

This project was the first part to developing [analyzemymeeting.com](http://analyzemymeeting.com/) - an app to get meeting statistics and visualisations. The first objective was to investigate how machine-learning could be used for this purpose. In particular we investigate how to build the input features from the audio recording and then using the k-means clustering algorithm to get various statistics on the meeting.

See this other repo for the actual deployed application ![analyzemymeeting-app](https://github.com/tsando/analyzemymeeting-app).
